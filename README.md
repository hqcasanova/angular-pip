# Ng-Todo — Yeoman's Todo app tutorial using Angular-seed

I wanted to get a feel of what exactly a Yeoman generator churns out as opposed to doing it manually, using Angular-seed in this case.

Yeoman's official generator for Angular still uses the “Sock Drawer” directory organization. Although it works for small projects, this approach doesn't scale very well. In fact, as of September 2014, Google's [Best Practice Recommendations for Angular App Structure](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XXMvReO8-Awi1EZXAXS4PzDzdNvV6pGcuaF4Q9821Es/pub) suggests a modular structure instead.
